**terraform-worker** is a command-line tool purpose-built for orchestrating large-scale, modular Terraform deployments. It enables precise control over provider versions, remote state scaffolding, and shared configuration logic ‚Äî ideal for enterprise infrastructure teams managing complex environments across multiple workspaces and deployment stages.

Unlike tools such as `terragrunt`, this is not a drop-in wrapper ‚Äî `terraform-worker` introduces a new structure and workflow model, optimized for maintainability, scalability, and declarative control, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

## üöÄ Features

- üîß Modularized state management across nested or sequential Terraform operations
- üß± Automated scaffolding of provider blocks, remote state configs, and input variables
- ‚ú® Jinja2 templating for flexible, environment-specific rendering
- üîí Enforces version consistency of modules and providers
- üß∞ Supports YAML, JSON, and HCL2 for configuration definitions
- üì¶ Clean CLI with pluggable backend and runtime overrides
- üîç Designed from the ground up for enterprise environments

---

## üîÑ Example Workflow

Here's a minimal example using `worker.yaml` to scaffold a VPC and RDS database with shared state:

```yaml
terraform:
  providers:
    aws:
      vars:
        region: {{ aws_region }}
        version: "~> 4.0"

  terraform_vars:
    region: {{ aws_region }}
    environment: dev

  definitions:
    network:
      path: /definitions/aws/network-existing

    database:
      path: /definitions/aws/rds
      remote_vars:
        subnet: network.outputs.subnet_id
```

Run the deployment:

```sh
% worker --aws-profile default --config-var aws_region=us-west-2 terraform deploy
```

Use custom worker options for flexibility:

```yaml
terraform:
  worker_options:
    backend: s3
    backend_prefix: tfstate
    terraform_bin: /usr/local/bin/terraform
```

---

## üìå Configuration Notes

- Config files may be written in YAML, JSON, or HCL2
- Configs support templating via [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)
- `terraform-worker` reads `worker.yaml` by default from the current directory
- Variables like `{{ aws_region }}` are injected via `--config-var` CLI args

---

## üß† How It Works

1. Parses your configuration into **definitions** (state modules)
2. Injects provider/version/variable blocks automatically
3. Handles remote state linking across module outputs
4. Creates ephemeral execution directories (unless `--no-clean` is used)
5. Delegates to native Terraform for execution (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, etc.)

---

## üß™ Development & Testing

Initialize the environment:

```bash
poetry install
make init
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## üì§ Releasing

Update the version and publish to PyPI:

```bash
poetry version <semver>
poetry publish --build
```

Configure credentials for Poetry using [these instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#configuring-credentials).

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

Use `--no-clean` to retain generated terraform files:

```sh
worker --no-clean terraform deploy
```

The tool will print the temporary directory it used, e.g.:

```text
using temporary Directory: /tmp/tmpew44uopp
```

You can `cd` into the generated definition to run manual Terraform commands for debugging.

---

## ü™ù Hook Scripts

Each Terraform action (`init`, `plan`, `apply`) can be extended via optional lifecycle hook scripts, enabling advanced custom logic around deployments.

### Supported Hook Types

For every definition, the following scripts are recognized and executed if present:

- `pre_init`, `post_init`
- `pre_plan`, `post_plan`
- `pre_apply`, `post_apply`

Scripts must be placed within the corresponding definition directory.

### Language & Execution

Hook scripts can be written in **any language** ‚Äî they are executed as standalone shell commands. Ensure the script has execution permissions (e.g., `chmod +x`).

Example:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
print("Pre-apply hook running for", os.environ.get("TF_WORKER_DEFINITION"))
```

### Environment Variable Access

The following environment variables are automatically injected into all hook scripts:

- `TF_`-prefixed variables for:
  - Terraform input variables (`TF_REGION`, `TF_ENVIRONMENT`, etc.)
  - Rendered template variables (e.g., Jinja context)
  - Remote state outputs
- Authentication credentials (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, etc.)

This allows hook scripts to dynamically read and interact with Terraform configuration and authentication context.

### Use Cases

- Pre-checks or assertions before deploys
- Dynamic secrets injection
- Notifications or logging
- External system integration (e.g., Slack, monitoring)

Hook scripts provide a powerful extension point for customizing behavior around each Terraform stage without modifying core logic.

## üîí Assuming a Role (AWS)

To execute with a specific IAM role:

```sh
worker --aws-role-arn arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/example \
       --aws-external-id my-id \
       terraform deploy
```

Configure the role and trust relationship per [AWS IAM guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html).

---

## üìö Documentation

Full documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/):

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

Open the local docs via:

```sh
open ./docs/build/index.html
```

## üß≠ Design Philosophy

**terraform-worker** was created from the ground up for production-first use in enterprise CI/CD systems, including:
- Large deployments with complex dependency graphs
- Strict version controls and reproducibility
- Integration with GitHub or API-driven configuration management

While it excels at scale, it‚Äôs also a powerful CLI for individuals who need structure without sacrificing flexibility.
